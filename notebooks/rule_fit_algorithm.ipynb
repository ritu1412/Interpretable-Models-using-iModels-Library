"]},"execution_count":24,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["visulaize= model.visualize()\n","visulaize"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["- **rule**: These are the rules and features generated from the decision tree model. The rules are based on conditions applied to features (e.g., `Age <= 43.5`, `Years of Experience > 5.5`). Some rows represent combinations of feature interactions.\n","- **coef**: These are the coefficients assigned to each rule or feature by the regression model. A positive coefficient suggests that the rule contributes positively to the target value 'salary', while a negative coefficient suggests that the rule contributes negatively.\n","\n","### Interpretation of Key Rows:\n","   - `Age (2322.68)`, `Years of Experience (577.78)`, `Gender_Male (2075.03)` have linear coefficients that indicate how much each feature contributes to the predicted target.Each additional year of age increases the predicted target by 2322.68 units (likely salary). Similarly, being male (`Gender_Male`) adds 2075.03 units to the prediction.\n","\n","   - The coefficients for `Education Level_Master's (10795.07)` and `Education Level_PhD (13250.02)` indicate the increase in the target (salary) for individuals with these education levels compared to the baseline (likely Bachelor's degree). Holding all else constant, individuals with a Master's degree earn about 10,795 units more than those with only a Bachelor's, while PhD holders earn about 13,250 units more.\n","\n","   - The rules like `Age <= 43.5 (-3279.11)` and `Years of Experience <= 12.5 (-4094.84)` represent decision-tree derived rules that interact with features. These rules capture non-linear relationships between features and the target. For instance, if an individual's age is less than or equal to 43.5 years, it decreases the target (e.g., salary) by 3279.11 units. Similarly, having fewer than or equal to 12.5 years of experience results in a reduction of 4094.84 units in the prediction.\n","\n","   - The rules that involve multiple features, such as `Age <= 40.5 and Years of Experience <= 5.5 (-1275.15)`, show how combinations of features impact the outcome.If both conditions are true (age ≤ 40.5 and years of experience ≤ 5.5), it decreases the predicted target (salary) by 1275.15 units. These rules help capture more complex relationships between variables that a linear regression alone might miss.\n","\n","   - Some more complex rules, like `Age > 40.5 and Years of Experience > 15.5 and Job Title_CEO <= 0.5 and Job Title_Chief Data Officer <= 0.5 and Education Level_Master's <= 0.5 and Education Level_PhD <= 0.5 (-3097.10)`, represent a combination of many conditions. This particular rule means that if a person does not have any of the listed titles or degrees, their predicted target decreases by 3097.10 units.The negative coefficient indicates that this rule captures a lower salary for individuals without a high-level job title or advanced degree.\n","\n","### Conclusion:\n","\n","- **Rules with Positive Coefficients:** Rules like `Years of Experience > 5.5 (826.58)` increase the prediction when the rule holds true. This makes sense: more experience or older age generally leads to higher salaries or better outcomes in many contexts.\n","  \n","- **Rules with Negative Coefficients:** Rules like `Years of Experience <= 12.5 (-4094.84)` lower the prediction when true. This reflects the fact that less experience or being younger might correlate with lower salaries or other outcomes."]}],"metadata":{"kaggle":{"accelerator":"none","dataSources":[{"datasetId":2973025,"sourceId":5119031,"sourceType":"datasetVersion"}],"dockerImageVersionId":30746,"isGpuEnabled":false,"isInternetEnabled":false,"language":"python","sourceType":"notebook"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.9.6"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
